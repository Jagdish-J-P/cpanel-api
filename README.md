cPanel UAPI and API2 PHP class
===

PHP class to provide an easy-to-use interface with cPanel's UAPI and API2.
Uses PHP magic functions to provide a simple and powerful interface.

## Usage

### Instantiate the class

Basic Authentication using cpanel username and password
```php

use JagdishJP\CPanelAPI\CPanelAPI;
use JagdishJP\CPanelAPI\AuthType;

$cPanel = new cpanelAPI('cpanel_username', 'cpanel_password', 'cpanel.example.com');
```

Authentication using cpanel username and API Token. You can create token from `Security -> Manage API Tokens`. Visit [Manage API Token](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/security/manage-api-tokens-in-cpanel/#overview)
```php

use JagdishJP\CPanelAPI\CPanelAPI;
use JagdishJP\CPanelAPI\AuthType;

$cPanel = new cpanelAPI('cpanel_username', 'cpanel_api_token', 'cpanel.example.com', AuthType::TOKEN);
```

The API we want to use and the Module (also called Scope) are now protected and are set by `__get()`.

The request layout looks like this: `$cPanel->api->method->Module->request(args[])`

The `->method` part should be replaced with `->get` for GET requests and `->post` for POST requests, or omitted to default to GET requests.

As an example, suppose we want to use the UAPI to call the [Mysql::get_server_information](https://api.docs.cpanel.net/openapi/cpanel/operation/Variables-get_server_information/) function:

```php
$response = $cPanel->uapi->Mysql->get_server_information();
var_dump($response);
```

Now that we have set both the API *and* the Module, we can call other functions within this API and Module without specifying them again:

```php
$response = $cPanel->create_database(['name' => $cPanel->user.'_MyDatabase']);
var_dump($response);
```

We can also change the Module scope without respecifying the API.  Note that the Module call is case-sensitive.

```php
$response = $cPanel->SSL->list_certs();
```

#### File upload example

```php
$cPanel = new cpanelAPI($username, $password, $hostname);
$cPanel->uapi->post->Fileman
       ->upload_files(['dir' => REMOTE_PATH_RELATIVE_TO_HOME,
                       'file-1' => new CURLFile(LOCAL_PATH_TO_FILE)
                       ]);
```

### API2

API2 is used in exactly the same way as the UAPI

```php
$cPanel = new cpanelAPI('user', 'password', 'cpanel.example.com');
```

For example, suppose we want to use the API2 to add a subdomain:

```php
$response = $cPanel->api2->SubDomain->addsubdomain(['rootdomain' => 'domain.com', 'domain' => 'sub']);
var_dump($response);
```

### Two-Factor Authentication

To use this class on a cPanel instance with two-factor authentication (2FA), you need to pass the secret into the class constructor:

```php
$cPanel = new cpanelAPI('user', 'password', 'cpanel.example.com', AuthType::BASIC, 'secret');
```

The secret can be found on the 2FA setup page. See [Two-Factor Authentication for cPanel â€“ Configure two-factor authentication](https://documentation.cpanel.net/display/ALD/Two-Factor+Authentication+for+cPanel#Two-FactorAuthenticationforcPanel-Configure2FA) for details.
